\chapter{Development Methodologies}

In order to achieve all the goals that this project has set out to achieve, a 
software development process will be required to be implemented and followed. 
The advantages of structuring such a software development project into a set of 
defined processes far outweighs the disadvantages \citep{knott_dawson99}. 

These defined processes form part of a process model, to which a process model 
can be described as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item a conquer and divide approach of problems into tasks at each stage;
	\item adding an element of control and planning;
	\item allowing for progress to be mapped visually;
	\item providing a structured approach to development;
	\item allowing for a higher quality of code and documentation to be produced.
\end{itemize}

The oldest formalised methodology for building software products was known as 
the systems development life cycle (SDLC) \citep{elliott04}. The SDLC
methodology utilises a structured and methodical approach, where by each stage 
of the life cycle is to be carried out rigidly and in order.

Within this chapter, various software development methodologies will be discussed 
and evaluated, ultimately leading to a software development methodology being 
chosen to use within this project.
