\section{Extreme Programming}
Extreme Programming is a software development methodology intended to improve 
upon the agile methodology. It attempts to do this by maintaining high software 
quality whilst also maintaining high responsiveness to changing client 
requirements \citep{knott_dawson99}.

As found in agile development, there are many frequent release, and development 
is completed in short cycles, intended to improve productivity and to introduce 
check points (client requirements can be changed).

\subsection{Advantages}
The extreme programming software development methodology shares the same 
advantages as the agile and the evolutionary prototyping methodologies.

\subsection{Disadvantages}
As with the advantages, the disadvantages of the extreme programming methodology 
are shared amongst the agile and the evolutionary prototyping methodologies.
