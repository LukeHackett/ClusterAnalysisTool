\section{Defining the Environment}

BlackBerry test multiple devices within an automated test harness upon various 
weekly global drive routes. These routes are designed to test and stress the
device to the limits.

When a device encounters an event (good or bad), a call log is generated. A 
call log that can be deemed as a `Call Drop', `Setup Failure' or 
`Successful Call'. 

Each device will go on test for a number of hours (usually six hours), and 
during that time, the device will:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Make an automated call that is due to last for ninety seconds;
  \item Perform email bombs (sending and receiving thousand's of emails during 
        a short time --- usually thirty seconds);
  \item Wait for thirty seconds before making the next call (to allow for any 
        logging process to finish).
\end{itemize}

On average a call log is generated every one hundred seconds, and to avoid data 
implosion, only the `Call Drop' and `Setup Failure' logs will be analysed.

Each test device is paired to a reference device. A reference device is a device
that is currently deemed `stable', and is usually one that can be bought 
by consumers. Note: a test device is {\em usually} one that is currently in 
development, however it could be a competitor's device.
