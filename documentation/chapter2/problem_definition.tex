\section{Defining the Problem}
\label{sec:defining_the_problem}

Based upon the given environment, there are a number of comparisons that can be
made, however the main comparisons that this project will focus upon are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Radio Access Technology (RAT);
  \item Frequency Mix-Bands;
  \item Radio Resource Controller (RRC).
\end{itemize}

Each of the above terminology will be expanded upon and defined within section 
\ref{sec:mobile_network_terminology}.

Fundamentally, the overall aim of this project is to `group' call logs into 
some form of comparable, well-defined categories.

By grouping the call logs from various devices and/or various different weeks,
test engineers are able to build a more solid picture of exactly the problems
that a device currently possess.

Once a problem has been identified, a number of solutions can then be proposed 
and ultimately can be implemented to fix the initial problem. It is the initial 
problem identification that this project and ultimately the product will focus 
upon.
