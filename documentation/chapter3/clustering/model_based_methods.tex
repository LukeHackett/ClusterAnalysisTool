\subsection{Model-Based Methods}
Model-based algorithms attempt to place a mathematical model over a set of data. 
This is generally based upon the assumption that data are generated by using 
various probability distributions \citep{han06}.

As with the grid-based methods, these methods are not applicable to this 
project.
