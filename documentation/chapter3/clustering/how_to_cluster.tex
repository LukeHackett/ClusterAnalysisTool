\subsection{Clustering Methods}
There are many clustering algorithms, and despite this it is quite difficult to 
provide a well-defined categorisation of these clustering methods, because many
of categories overlap each other \citep{everitt74}.
For the purposes of this project, the following five categories will be used:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Partitioning
  \item Hierarchical
  \item Density-based
  \item Grid-based
  \item Model-based
\end{itemize}
