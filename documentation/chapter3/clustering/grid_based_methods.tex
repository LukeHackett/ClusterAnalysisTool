\subsection{Grid-Based Methods}
Grid-based algorithms utilise a multi-resolution grid structure. The algorithm 
will limit the object space into a set number of cells that forms a grid. It is 
upon this grid that all of the clustering operations are performed 
\citep{han06}.

The grid is generally a multi-dimensional structure, and therefore is not 
really applicable to clustering coordinates.
