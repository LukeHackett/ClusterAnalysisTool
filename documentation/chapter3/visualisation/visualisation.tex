\section{Visualisation}

Vast amounts of information is given to use on a daily basis. Everything from 
emails to credit card statements, from variations in the stock markets to the 
last-minute holiday offers, we are continuously bombarded with information.

All of the above examples have a common question that we subconsciously ask 
ourselves every time a new piece of information is obtained: Which email can 
can we delete because it doesn't interest us?  How much is outstanding upon 
the credit card? Do we need to cut back in the future? The common theme is
decision making.

We are not witnessing an explosion of information, but an explosion of data 
\citep{riccardo09}. It is this data that we are continuously trying to observe,
process and develop for everyday lives.

This leads to an interesting question, how is information created from data?

\citep{jacobson09} describes the process of understanding where data as the 
``continuum of understanding''. The continuum of understanding 
(Figure \ref{fig:datawisdom}), highlights how data can be transformed into 
information, and then into knowledge and ultimately wisdom.

There are four main features within the process, as outlined below 
\citep{riccardo09}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Data} are entities that have no meaning. They are the ``building 
        blocks'' of information.
  \item {\bf Information} provides meaning to data, by processing, organising, 
        and presenting in a suitable format.
  \item {\bf Knowledge} is the combination of information and experience. When 
        experiences are gained we are able to acquire the knowledge to help us 
        understand things.
  \item {\bf Wisdom} is the ``highest level of comprehension''. In order to 
        have wisdom, a person will have needed to have acquired such an 
        advanced level of knowledge.
\end{itemize}

Information visualisation is located between data and information, as it 
provides the methods to organise and represent the data, but does not provide 
any direct knowledge or wisdom acquisition \citep{riccardo09}. 

The remainder of this chapter will focus upon visualisation techniques.
