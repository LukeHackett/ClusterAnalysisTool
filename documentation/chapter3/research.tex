\chapter{Research}

In the previous chapter a detailed approach to what the project will cover was 
discussed. In order to correctly implement a working piece of a software a 
number of areas will need to be researched thoroughly.

Based upon the problem analysis, the the main topics that have been identified 
are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mobile Networks
  \item Clustering Techniques
  \item Visualisation Techniques
\end{itemize}
