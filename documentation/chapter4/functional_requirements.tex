\section{Functional Requirements}
The functional requirements of a system are those that set out the features 
that any software solution should provide \citep{cadle10}. This is only 
intended to be a brief overview, a more detailed specification can be found 
within the specification section of this document.

\subsection{Data entry}
The gathering and recording of data will be handled by BlackBerry. The end 
product will not in any way need to gather data, however it will need to 
process a set of data found within a given file.

\subsection{Data maintenance}
As the gathering and recording of data is handled by BlackBerry, the requests 
for additional data or for the data to be changed, must be first authorised by 
BlackBerry. 

\subsection{Procedure}
New features, or analysis procedures that are outside of the project 
specification must be first authorised for use by BlackBerry.

\subsection{Retrieval}
The retrieval of data is concerned with the accuracy and integrity of the data.
In order to achieve high accuracy and integrity additional internal knowledge 
is required that is unable to be shared with third parties of BlackBerry. It is
therefore assumed that all data pushed from BlackBerry is correct.
