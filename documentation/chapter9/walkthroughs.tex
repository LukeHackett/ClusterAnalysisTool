\section{Walkthroughs}
\label{sec:walkthroughs}

The previous section (section \ref{sec:unit_testing}) discussed the automated 
test strategy. These tests assume that the data being passed around the system 
has been entered correctly.

In order to ensure that incorrect data can not interfere with the system, and 
number of `manual' walkthroughs have been proposed.

Each walkthough will ensure that the system rejects data and parameters that 
are deemed to be incorrect, and should inform the user of any incorrect data 
and parameters.
